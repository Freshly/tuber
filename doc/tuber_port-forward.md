## tuber port-forward

forward requests from your local machine to a running pod

### Synopsis

Forward requests from a local address and port to a running pod.
You are able to specify multiple addresses and ports, but all combinations must be valid and running.

This command will always run against a single pod until either that pod terminates or this command is closed.

Specifying a workload:
The workload name will default to the app name if not supplied. If the workload name is not the same as the app name, that argument will be required to run the command successfully.

For example. When the desired workload is a deployment named 'user-service-sidekiq' within a tuber app named 'user-service':
tuber port-forward -a user-service -w user-service-sidekiq 9292

Specifying pods:
If no pod name is supplied a pod will be randomly selected for you. To target a specific pod that can be supplied as an argument to '-p' or '--pod'.


```
tuber port-forward -a appName [port(s)] [flags]
```
